# Product Sales Analysis - Audio Equipment

This project involves the analysis of sales data for electronic products, specifically focusing on audio equipment. The goal of the project is to provide insights into sales trends, identify key factors influencing sales performance, and visualize the data using SQL and Power BI.

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: Used to query and extract relevant sales data from a database.
- **Power BI**: Used for creating interactive dashboards to visualize the sales trends, key performance indicators (KPIs), and other relevant metrics.

## Project Overview
The dataset used for this analysis contains sales information for various audio equipment products, including speakers, headphones, and other audio-related devices. The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: SQL queries were used to extract sales data, including product details, sales dates, and revenue information.
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: The data was cleaned and transformed to ensure consistency and accuracy.
3. **Data Visualization**: Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards that allow users to explore sales trends, performance by product, and regional variations.

## Key Insights
- **Sales Trends**: Identified seasonal sales patterns and peak sales periods.
- **Top Performing Products**: Highlighted the best-selling audio equipment products.
- **Revenue Analysis**: Analyzed revenue by region, product category, and time period.
- **Regional Insights**: Provided visual insights into how products perform in different geographic locations.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the Power BI file (`Sales_Analysis.pbix`) to explore the dashboard.
3. Review the SQL queries used to extract and analyze the data in the SQL script files.
